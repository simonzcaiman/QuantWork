When you try to download a large amount of data using Bloomberg Matlab API, like fundamental data for 1000+ stocks for 20+ years
your matlab history function might run for a while and return a java heap memory error.

for example: 
run the following code
[d1,sec]=history(c,sec,fields,fromdate,todate,period)

matlab return an error in java heap memory.

Here is one way you can increase your max heap max. 
1. First try 
java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime.maxMemory
to see how much maximum memory you have now
2. change the parameter in slider in Preferences->Matlab->General-> Java Heap Memory and raise the maxium 

Hope this help some of you!
